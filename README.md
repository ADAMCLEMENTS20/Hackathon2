# CU Courseview

## Description
CU Courseview is an All-In-One tool that allows Clemson students to locate all of the information they may need for the course registration process. By simply entering a course code (ie "CPSC") and course number (ie 4620), a student can see the course description, all of the professors who have historically taught the course, their grade distributions, and their RateMyProfessor ratings. This tool should allow students to determine which courses they would like to take, and which professor they would like to take it with. Of note, this was a Hackathon project that was written in 24 hours by 2 programmers. We won the "Best use of MATLAB" category at the 2023 Clemson Hackathon.

## Technical Details
Data: Held in a csv file that has been cleaned and reorganized with a MATLAB Script
Back End: This project used 2 custom written Python Web Scraping APIs designed by Adam to retrieve the course description from the Clemson course catalog, and the professor's ratings from RateMyProfessor
Front End: Simple HTML/CSS to make the website retrieve information from the user and display the results written by Sam.
Frameworks: React.js and Django were used to support the Python Back End. Sam combined the front and back ends.
